Fraud detection is a very popular, important and interesting application of machine learning. Thereâ€™re a few articles out there that cover this topic, but most of them make use of transformed data and hence miss some of the interesting parts of this process i.e. cleaning the data, handling categorical values and handling data imbalance. We try to make this article very easy to follow but also very informative and full of substance.
